## Username

Although my real name is Lucas Costa, I've been nicknamed "Evaristo" since my undergraduate years — a nickname I'm not entirely sure of the origin. The nickname stuck so well that many of my acquaintances probably don't even remember my real name. Because of this, and for other reasons, I chose "evaristocosta" as my username.
